# Sign Language Recognition
[~ By Mayuresh Patil]()

In this sign language recognition project, we create a sign detector, which detects numbers from 1 to 10 that can very easily be extended to cover a vast multitude of other signs and hand gestures including the alphabets.
## ImageDataGenerator

We load the data using ImageDataGenerator of keras through which we can use the flow_from_directory function to load the train and test set data, and each of the names of the number folders will be the class names for the imgs loaded.
